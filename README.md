## General

General stickers usable by anyone to represent or promote RSE stuff.


### "DO disturb"

These stickers have a message that you are interested in talking about
doing things and helping people.  They are a bit whimsical ("DO
disturb") and use a set of emojis to represent what you want to talk
about.

Setup: Edit with Inkscape (Linux is tested, others probably work).
Install Noto fonts (`fonts-noto-core` is probably enough, the emoji
don't directly in inkscape and have to be imported manually).  Take
note of the layers and make sure you select the right ones.

Emojis: `git clone git@github.com:adobe-fonts/noto-emoji-svg` and
Verify it's the Apache 2 license.  search for unicode characters hex
codes within that repo.  Inkscape → File → Import and import the svg
file.


## Tool series

These represent the idea that the tools of RSE/scientific computer
make a lot of other research possible.
